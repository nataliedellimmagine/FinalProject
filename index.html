  <h3 class='centerText'>ABOUT ME</h3><br>
      <p id='aboutMe'>I am a sophomore at Menlo Atherton High School. I like to code, sleep, unicycle, and hang out with friends. I am on the M-A swim team and used to play volleyball. I play violin and participate in my high school orchestra. This year the orchestra went to New York, and played at Carnegie Hall. In the future, I would like to be an engineer or go to the Olympics. I have always been amazed by the Olymics and have always wanted to go, even if I don't win. I want to be an engineer because I have always liked taking things apart and building things. This week at DMA, I learned about front-end development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
